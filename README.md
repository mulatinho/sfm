Simple File Manager [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mulatinho/sfm?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mulatinho/sfm)
===================

This project is a lightweight file manager written only for fun and profit,
it is written in C with GTK and have some features to interact with remote
(samba and ssh) file systems. Another cool tool that we want to make in future
is the SFM file manager in text console with NCURSES library. Wait for it!
